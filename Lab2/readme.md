## Executive Summary 
This week I will be using resources to get a better understanding of different components of a computer. To deepen our knowledge I am also learning how different components interact with on another. By learning how to convert decimal, binary and hexadecimal I will get to learn about how the computer performs its tasks. 

## Hardware
Hardware are devices that you can touch. Some examples of hardware are desktop computers, keyboards and scanners.
### Hard Drives and Memory
Hard drives are long term storage for the data.  
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is the average time for a sector to get into position under a head after a finished seek and is calculated by using spindle speed. While transfer rates is the speed that data is transferred to and from the disk media. A host transfer rate is the speed that a computer can transfer data across IDE/ EIDE or SCSI interface to the CPU. Internal transfer rate is the speed the disk moves data from the head to internal buffers. Disk RPM directly effects latency and transfer rates. 
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Hard drives is the physical disk that is used to read or write data. In order for it to use the data, it has to be in a perfect position. They can be prone to errors due to mechanical issues, or when objects get into the device that can cause it to break. With a solid state drive there is no moving parts and data is stored in memory. 
#### Random Access Memory
RAM is primary memory and temporary storage that is stored in DIMMS that are installed on the motherboard. The hard drive sends information to RAM and the CPU will use this data in order to run the program. Extra data that cannot be sent and stored to the RAM gets sent back to the hard drive to get cycled back through RAM, which slows down the computer. By increasing more RAM on the motherboard, the faster the computer will run. Requires constant power to store data, without power the information is no longer stored in RAM. SDRAM is used today in RAM DIMMS, which is faster than the prior technology of DRAM. A single BIT is the smallest form a computer can read.The more bits that are able to be stored in RAM, the faster the computer will be. So, a 64 Bit data path is faster than the 32 Bit data path. 
### ALU and the Control Unit
ALU uses flags to help the control unit know what to do.
### CPU, Input & Output
CPU is short for central processing unit. The clock is a wire that turns on and off in order to keep the CPU in sync. The CPU fits onto the mother board. The CPU requests and process information from RAM usually in order, but can be done not in order. If the CPU turns on the enable wire, RAM will send that data to the CPU to be processed. Once the CPU processes the data, it will send another requested to RAM to continue the cycle and get more data. If the CPU needs to save data from RAM it outputs an address, data and puts on the set wire to override the data at that address with the new data. Each CPU has an instruction set it understands. For example, they can have a load instruction that puts RAM into CPU. ADD instructions that will add the numbers together, or a STORE instruction that saves the result of the addition back to the RAM to be used later. Compare instruction that comparest each numbers to see which number is larger or if they are the same. This compare instruction is useful while using a JUMP IF instruction to know where to get out of order data. Output instructions go to devices such are the monitor. While input instructions are from devices such as keyboards or mouses. 
### Logic Gates 
George Boole created the concept of logic gates and they add, subtract and divide electrical currents. A logic gate is an electrical circuit with two inputs and an output. So, it recieves two electrical currents, compares them and sends a new one depending on what it finds. An example of common logic gates are AND, OR or NOT.

#IEEE Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE is dedicated to advancing innovation and technology to benefit humanity. It consists of engineers, scientists and professionals that come together to innovate what we know as modern technology. Their goal is to create products and new technology to enhance human day to day life. 
## Data Representation
Data representation can be done through many forms of communication on a computer. It is important to have good data visualization for a viewer to better understand. 
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
A decimal uses ten digits. Binary uses two digits and Hexadecimal uses 16.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
#ab00ff is pure or mostly violet. It can be a useful color if you needed it to be used as a contrast color on a figure. However, this color is very bright so it could be hard on user viewing the information if it was consistently.
## Conclusion
I have learned more about computer systems and how they work with eachother. I have also practiced conversions from decimal to binary to have a deeper understanding of how my computer operates.
