## Executive Summary
My goal in this course is to get a better understanding of programming in order to advance in my career. I want to get a better understanding of GitHub and succeed in this course. In this summary I will be describing different parts of information systems and defining what client-server architecture and cloud computing are. 

## Information System Components
There are two categories of information systems are they are technology and components. The first three that are technology are hardware, software and data. Hardware examples include keyboards and computers while software are operating systems and application software. Data collects information such as phone numbers and social media accounts. One of the components are people and they are important because they can use tools to understand information that is generated from computers. The last component is processes, which is how organization of each tool and how it is used can lead to better results.

### Client - Server Architecture
The client-server architecture allows a person to log into the Local Area Network by connecting to a server. It also has allowed for data sharing so that multiple people can have access to the same data. Therefore, people in the company can have efficient and constant communication. This lead to the development of Enterprise Resource Planning systems. This has given companies a centralized database to run their business. 
### Cloud Computing
This provides users with mobile access to data and applications so that computers are used to be able to communication, rather than just an information center. 
## Conclusion
I have learned how to get a repository started on GITHUB, add a screen shot on the site as well as how to edit the readme text. This first chapter has given me insight on the basics of information systems and how they have developed through out time. I am excited to learn more about programming and IT in future chapters.
